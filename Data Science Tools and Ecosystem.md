# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

**Objectives:**

- List popular languages for Data Science
- Create tables and lists in a Jupyter Notebook
- Use Markdown cells to add documentation
- Perform arithmetic operations in Python
- Convert units like minutes to hours


# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

1. Python  
2. R  
3. SQL  
4. Julia  
5. Java


# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

1. NumPy  
2. pandas  
3. matplotlib  
4. scikit-learn  
5. TensorFlow  
6. ggplot2


| Data Science Tools        |
|---------------------------|
| Jupyter Notebook          |
| RStudio                   |
| Apache Zeppelin           |


### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
result = (3 * 4) + 5
print(result)
17


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60

hours = 200 / 60
print(hours)
3.3333333333333335
